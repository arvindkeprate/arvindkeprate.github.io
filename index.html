    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a Professor at Oslo Metropolitan University where I teach various Design-related courses such as Machine Design, Process & Piping Design, and Sustainable Design to Mechanical Engineering students. I also teach various courses related to Machine Learning, Probability & Statistics, Data Analytics, and Python at Kristiania University College in Oslo. Currently, I am the Leader of the Mechanics, Mechatronics, and Materials Technology (M3T) Research Group at OsloMet and also the Project Manager for the GrønnMet lab. Besides this, I am also a member of the Doctoral Committee at the faculty.</p>
        <p>I have over 10 years of industrial experience (Reliance Industries Limited, DNV) as a pipeline engineer, with expertise in fatigue analysis, fitness-for-service (FFS) assessment, asset integrity, and risk/reliability engineering. I am a researcher specializing in the application of machine learning and probabilistic techniques to Condition Monitoring, Prognostics, Reliability Modelling, and Integrity Assessment of engineering assets. Currently, my research is focused on PHM of complex Socio-Ecological Technical Systems such as Wind Farms.</p>
        <p>I have been awarded research grants from funding agencies, including the Research Council of Norway (RCN), Norwegian Directorate for Higher Education and Skills (HK-dir), Norwegian AI Research Consortium (NORA), and RegionaleForskningFond (RFF).</p>
        <p>I also serve as an Associate Editor for the International Journal of System Assurance Engineering and Management, Springer-Nature, and have been a topic editor for a Special Issue on “Online Monitoring of Wind Power Plants Using Digital TwinModels”, Frontiers in Energy Research.</p>
